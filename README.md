## Description
This is a React application built using JavaScript and React.js. It serves as a movie information viewer with the functionality of searching and sorting based on the movie's release year and episode. Here's a short description of its key features:

 -- Fetching Movie Data: The component fetches movie data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) upon mounting.

 -- Search Functionality: Users can search for movies by entering a query in the Search component. The movie list updates dynamically based on the search query.

 -- Sorting Functionality: Users can sort the movie list by either release year or episode number using the SortBy component. 


 ## Here are the steps for someone else to use your React MovieApp code from GitHub:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
   -- git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   -- Replace 'your-username' with your GitHub username and 'your-repository' with the name of your MovieApp repository.
   
### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:
  -- cd MovieApp

### 3. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install the project dependencies:
  -- npm install

### 4. Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:
  -- npm start
  -- This command will launch the development server and open the MovieApp in your default web browser. You can view and interact with the application at 'http://localhost:3000'.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
